title: "The scaling relations between the mass of supermassive black holes and properties of the host galaxies at high redshifts"
excerpt: "Supermassive black holes and their host galaxies have highly correlated properties, which indicates possible co-evolution between them. These correlations have been better measured in low-redshift galaxies. However, 
in high-redshift galaxies, there are difficulties regarding mass measurement of black holes and decomposition of galaxy structures. To address this problem, we study hot-DOGs (hot dust-obscured galaxies). Cores of these galaxies are easier to be told from other parts. Ultimately, this study aims to improve the correlation between black holes and bulges."

One of the results of coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, the scaling relations of supermassive black holes and host galaxies, are well mapped in the local universe. However, the scaling relations at high redshift are unclear because of the difficulty in black hole mass measurement and decomposition of galaxies. To address this problem, we study hot-DOGs (hot dust-obscured galaxies). Cores of these galaxies are easier to be told from other parts. Several selection criteria were first established to obtain the hot-DOGs sample from data releases of the SDSS and WISE surveys. Subsequently, I conducted multi-wavelength image decomposition of these high-redshift galaxies using Python package GALFITM to derive the luminosity and velocity dispersion of bulges in them. Combined with the mass measurement of black holes in literature, this enhanced our understanding of correlations between black holes and their host galaxies.
