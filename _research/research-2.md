title: "Position of radio AGNs relative to the star-forming main sequence"
excerpt: "Co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies is an fundamental question. One of
the ways to investigate this question is to look at the star formation rates of AGNs rel-
ative to normal star forming galaxies. To look at this issue, I analyzed galaxy and AGN
data from three deep-drilling fields to determine the star-forming main sequence. My
results show host galaxies of radio AGNs lie below the main sequence at low redshifts,
and lie on or above the main sequence at higher redshifts.
