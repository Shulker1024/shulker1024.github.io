### Coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies
Supermassive black holes and their host galaxies have highly correlated properties, which indicates possible coevolution between them. These correlations have been better measured in low-redshift galaxies. However, 
in high-redshift galaxies, there are difficulties regarding mass measurement of black holes and decomposition of galaxy structures. To address this problem, we study hot-DOGs(hot dust-obscured galaxies). Cores of these galaxies are easier to be told from other parts. Ultimately, this study aims to improve the correlation between black holes and bulges.
