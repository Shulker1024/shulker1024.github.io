title: "Co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies"
excerpt: "Supermassive black holes and their host galaxies have highly correlated properties, which indicates possible co-evolution between them. These correlations have been better measured in low-redshift galaxies. However, 
in high-redshift galaxies, there are difficulties regarding mass measurement of black holes and decomposition of galaxy structures. To address this problem, we study hot-DOGs(hot dust-obscured galaxies). Cores of these galaxies are easier to be told from other parts. Ultimately, this study aims to improve the correlation between black holes and bulges."

I am currently selecting multiband images of high-redshift hot-DOGs.
