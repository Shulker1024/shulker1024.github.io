title: "Position of radio AGNs relative to the star-forming main sequence"
excerpt: "Co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies is an fundamental question. One of
the ways to investigate this question is to look at the star formation rates of AGNs rel-
ative to normal star forming galaxies. To look at this issue, I analyzed galaxy and AGN
data from three deep-drilling fields to determine the star-forming main sequence. My
results show host galaxies of radio AGNs lie below the main sequence at low redshifts,
and lie on or above the main sequence at higher redshifts."

As for now, compelling evidence suggests that radio AGNs have lower star-formation rates than normal galaxies in the local universe. However, whether radio AGNs quench star formation at higher redshifts is unclear. Some individual cases indicate that radio AGNs can have more significant star-forming rates than normal galaxies. With this in mind, we utilized newly released data from three Chandra Deep-Drilling Fields to compare the star formation rates of radio AGN host galaxies and typical star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts. I determine the star-forming main sequence (MS) and used statistical method to compare star-formation rates of radio AGNs relative to it. The results suggest that radio AGN host galaxies fall below the main sequence at low redshifts, while at higher redshifts, they live on or slightly above it. A manuscript based on this work is currently in preparation.
