Research experience
======
### July 2023–Present
Position of radio AGNs relative to the star-forming main sequence


Advisor: Professor William Nielsen Brandt (The Pennsylvania State University).


- established the star-forming main sequence and the position of radio AGNs relative to it using data from three deep-drilling fields 
- suggested that at high redshifts, radio AGNs live on or slightly above the main sequence 
- proposed an empirical model for how the shift of an AGN from main sequence evolves as a function of redshift and stellar mass

### September 2022–Present
The scaling relations between the mass of supermassive black holes and properties of the host galaxies at high redshifts


Advisor: Professor Lulu Fan (University of Science and Technology of China).


- selected hot dust-obscured galaxies (hot-DOGs) using data from WISE and SDSS
- conducted multiwavelength image decomposition of hot-DOGs and derived luminosity and velocity dispersion of bulges in them
- explored the correlations between black hole mass and bulge luminosity, as well as the correlations between black hole mass and velocity dispersion
