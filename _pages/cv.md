Research experience
======
### July 2023–Present
Position of radio AGNs relative to the star-forming main sequence


Advisor: Niel Brandt (The Pennsylvania State University).


Co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies is an fundamental question. One of
the ways to investigate this question is to look at the star formation rates of AGNs rel-
ative to normal star forming galaxies. To look at this issue, I analyzed galaxy and AGN
data from three deep-drilling fields to determine the star-forming main sequence. My
results show host galaxies of radio AGNs lie below the main sequence at low redshifts,
and lie on or above the main sequence at higher redshifts.

### September 2022–Present
Correlation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies


Advisor: Lulu Fan (USTC).


Using data from several sky surveys, I conducted multi-wavelength image decomposition of high-redshift galaxies, in order to derive luminosity and velocity dispersion of bulges in them. Combined with mass measurement of black holes, this would improve our understanding of correlations between black holes and their host galaxies.
